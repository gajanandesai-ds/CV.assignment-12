    "Quick R-CNN is a variation of the Faster R-CNN architecture for object detection. It is an improved version of the R-CNN architecture which uses a single network to predict both the object's location and its class. Quick R-CNN uses a region proposal network (RPN) to generate candidate bounding boxes of potential objects in an image. These bounding boxes are then fed into a separate network to classify the objects and refine their locations. The RPN works by scanning a predefined set of anchor boxes across the image, and predicting a score for each one indicating how likely it is to contain an object of interest. The network then outputs a set of bounding boxes which are used as input to the second network. This second network is a convolutional neural network (CNN) which is responsible for predicting the class label of the object inside the bounding box, as well as refining the location of the box. The Quick R-CNN architecture is faster than the original R-CNN architecture due to the fact that it uses a single network to both generate and classify the bounding boxes."

The convolutional layers extract features from the input data and the upsampling layers are used to increase the resolution of the input data. The upsampling layers are also used to merge features from different layers of the network. The end result is an output that is a segmentation of the input data into the desired classes.
